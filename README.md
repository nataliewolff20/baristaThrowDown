# baristaThrowDown


PROJECT: BARISTA BATTLE. https://nataliewolff20.github.io/

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery.

DESCRIPTION: A Coffee Shop Throwdown simulator that pits the Hero, "Rebel" against their Enemy, "Grumpy" in a 1on1 latte art battle. The competition is graded on 3 categories, taste, quality and presentation.

APPROACH: I started with a basic wireframe that would include a battle scenario, pop-up modal with game instructions, basic html and css backdrop. The battle scenario took most of my time to get to work properly. I used a javascript array randomizer function to compare scores between the two competitors and to decide the winner. Once this was completed, I constructed a button that would initialize the battle function and then output the random numbers that were captured in the randomizer function and insert them into a text alert at the bottom of the page.



PLANNED FEATURES:
- Have the lattes animate in on click
- A scenario where you could choose to be one of 3 pre-loaded baristas which would have different strengths and weaknesses which would show in their array of stats
- Having the player go through 3 rounds of battles, each round against a different BadGuyBarista of increasing pre-loaded skill levels
- Player to be given prompts asking you to make decisions between rounds that would either improve or decrease your skill levels. For example, before the first round you are offered a beverage. You can have a water or a beer. If you take the water, +=2 quality and if you take the beer, +=1 presentation but -=1 taste. Another example, you are offered a donut or a banana. Donut -= quality, banana +2 quality.
